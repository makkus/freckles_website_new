*freckles* is a young project, so there are still a lot of things that are not in place yet. And quite a few tools that could be developed on top of it. Here are the ones that already exist, or ones that are planned.

<p>Data-centric configuration management for your workstation, server, VM, or container.</p><p>Whether you want to setup a new laptop with your usual applications and configuration, whether you want to start developing on a Wordpress site, or any other sort of project that uses a known data structure, *frecklecute* is your friend.</p> | <p>Declarative, idempotent command-line scripting.</p><p>Meant as a quick way to create powerful command-line scripts that can, optionally, take user input via options or agruments. Because it uses Ansible modules and roles as it's buliding blocks, there is never a need to check the current state of your target machine manually, as that is usually done within those modules and roles already.</p> | <p>A tool to help you develop and debug any of the plug-ins you come across in the freckle-sphere.</p><p>So far it contains a log-viewer, tools to list and describe available adapters, roles, modules, etc., and a helper to create a new *freckelize* adapter from scratch.</p>
